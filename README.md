## Introduction

Braille is a tactile writing system used by people with visual impairments. Traditionally, braille was written by embossing paper. Today, people typically use a braille writer, such as a portable braille notetaker or computer that prints with a braille embosser. As for reading computer screens, braille users have the option of using refreshable braille displays. What makes it refreshable is whenever the user moves their cursor through keyboard or voice commands, the display updates the dots in the braille cells.
